Let A and B be two point sets in the plane of sizes r and n respectively (assume r \leq n), and let k be a parameter. A matching between A and B is a family M of pairs between A and B, so that any point of A or B appears in at most one pair. Given two integers p, q \geq 1, we define the cost of M to be the sum over ||a - b||_p^q of all its pairs (a, b), where ||x||_p is the L_p-norm. The geometric partial matching problem asks to find the minimum-cost size-k matching between A and B.

We present efficient algorithms for geometric partial matching that work for any powers of L_p-norm matching objective: An exact algorithm that runs in O((n + k^2)\polylog n) time, and a (1 + \epsilon)-approximation algorithm that runs in O((n + k\sqrt{k})\polylog n * \log\epsilon^{-1}) time. Both algorithms are based on primal-dual flow augmentation scheme; the main improvements are obtained by using dynamic data structures to achieve efficient flow augmentations. Using similar techniques, we give an exact algorithm for the planar transportation problem that runs in O((r^2\sqrt{n} + rn^{3/2})\polylog n) time. For r = o(\sqrt{n}), this algorithm is faster than the state-of-art near-quadratic time algorithm by Agarwal et al. [SOCG 2016].
